Deutsch's is a 'black box' problem; an artificial problem where we're allowed to apply a function to our bits, but we're not allowed to look at how the function works. The challenge is to discover some properties of the box by trying different inputs and outputs.\n",

The function will leave bit $ a $ alone, but may, or may not, flip bit $ b $. Deutsch's problem asks us to work out whether $f$ behaves differently depending on the value of $ a $ (we'll call this \"balanced\" behaviour), or if it ignores $ a $ and always does the same thing to $ b $ (\"constant\" behaviour). The challenge is to do this while applying $f$ as few times as possible.\n",
