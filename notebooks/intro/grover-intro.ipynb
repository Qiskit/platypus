    "\n",
    "A lot of the problems that computers solve are types of _search problems_. You’ve probably already searched the web using a search engine, which is a program that builds a database from websites and allows you to search through it. We can think of a database as a program that takes an address as input, and outputs the data at that address. A phone book is one example of a database; each entry in the book contains a name and number. For example, we might ask the database to give us the data in at the 3441<sup>st</sup> address, and it will return the 3441<sup>st</sup> name and number in the book.\n",

    "We call this process of providing an input and reading the output \"querying the database\". Often in computer science, we consider databases to be black boxes, which means we're not allowed to see how they work; we’ll just assume they're magical processes that do exactly as they promise. We call magical processes like these \"oracles\".\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have someone's name and we’re trying to find their phone number, this is easy if the book is sorted alphabetically by name. We can use an algorithm called _binary search_.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. The first step is to create an equal superposition of every possible input to the oracle. If our qubits all start in the state $|0\\rangle$, we can create this superposition by applying a H-gate to each qubit. We’ll call this equal superposition state '$|s\\rangle$'.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The next step is to run the oracle circuit ($U_\\text{oracle}$) on these qubits. On this page, we'll use the circuit (`oracle`) Qiskit created for us above, but we could use any circuit or hardware that changes the phases of solution states.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The final step is to run a circuit called the 'diffusion operator' or 'diffuser' ($U_s$) on the qubits. We'll go over this circuit when we explore Grover's algorithm in the next section, but it's a remarkably simple circuit that is the same for any oracle.\n",

    "We then need to repeat steps 2 & 3 a few times depending on the size of the circuit. Note that step #2 is the step in which we query the oracle, so the number of times we do this is roughly proportional to the square root of the size of the number of possible inputs. If we repeat 2 & 3 enough times, then when we measure, we'll have a high chance of measuring a solution to the oracle.\n",

    "So far, we’ve treated SAT problems as if they’re completely unstructured, but unlike the unsorted phonebook, we _do_ have some clues that will help us in our search. A SAT problem isn’t a black box, but a set of individual clauses, and we can use these clauses to home in on a correct answer. We won’t get anything nearly as efficient as binary search, but it’s still much better than random guessing. One (classical) algorithm that uses the structure of SAT problems is Schöning’s algorithm.\n",

    "\n",
    "Like random guessing, Schöning’s algorithm chooses an input at random and checks if it works. But unlike random guessing, it doesn’t just throw this string away. Instead, it picks an unsatisfied clause and toggles a bit in the string to satisfy that clause. Annoyingly, this new string might unsatisfy a different, previously-satisfied clause, but on average it's beneficial to keep toggling bits in this manner a few times. If the initial guess was close enough, there’s a fair chance we’ll stumble upon the correct solution. If not, then after some number of steps, the computer starts again with a new completely random guess. It turns out for 3-SAT (although not (>3)-SAT), this algorithm grows with roughly $1.3334^n$, which not only beats random guessing, but also beats Grover's algorithm!\n",

    "\n",
    "It may not be obvious at first glance, but we can actually combine Grover and Schöning's algorithms to get something even better than either individually. If you create a circuit that carries out the bit-toggling part of Schöning's algorithm, you can use this as the oracle and use Grover's algorithm to find the best \"initial guess\". We won't go into it in this course, but it's a fun project to investigate it!"
