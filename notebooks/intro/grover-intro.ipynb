    "A lot of the problems that computers solve are types of _search problems_. You’ve probably already searched the web using a search engine, which is a program that builds a database from websites and allows you to search through it. We can think of a database as a program that takes an address as input, and outputs the data at that address. A phonebook is one example of a database; each entry in the book contains a name and number. For example, we might ask the database to give us the data in at the 3441<sup>st</sup> address, and it will return the 3441<sup>st</sup> name and number in the book.\n",

    "We call this process of providing an input and reading the output \"querying the database\". Often in computer science, we consider databases to be black boxes, which means we're not allowed to see how they work; we’ll just assume they're magical processes that do exactly as they promise. We call magical processes like these \"oracles\".\n",

    "If we have someone's name and we’re trying to find their phone number, this is easy if the book is sorted alphabetically by name. We can use an algorithm called _binary search_.\n",

If we can make a problem _look_ like a database search problem, then we can use a search algorithm to solve it. For example, let’s consider the problem of solving a sudoku. If someone claims to have solved a sudoku, you can check if it’s solved pretty quickly: You check along each row, check along each column, check each square, and you’re finished. In this sense, _you_ are the database, and the person that gave you the solution is querying you. They are trying to find the input that returns the information “yes this is a valid solution”.\n",

    "So, now we understand the problem, we finally come to Grover’s algorithm. There are essentially three steps to Grover’s algorithm: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The first step is to create an equal superposition of every possible input to the oracle. If our qubits all start in the state $|0\\rangle$, we can create this superposition easily by applying a H-gate to each qubit. We’ll call this equal superposition state '$|s\\rangle$'.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The next step is to run the oracle circuit ($U_\\text{oracle}$) on these qubits. On this page, we'll use the circuit (`oracle`) Qiskit created for us above, but we could use any circuit or hardware that changes the phases of solution states.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The final step is to run a circuit called the 'diffusion operator' or 'diffuser' ($U_s$) on the qubits. We'll go over this circuit when we explore Grover's algorithm in the next section, but it's a remarkably simple circuit that is the same for any oracle.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then need to repeat steps 2 & 3 a few times depending on the size of the circuit. Note that step #2 is the step in which we query the oracle, so the number of times we do this is roughly proportional to the square root of the size of the number of possible inputs. If we repeat 2 & 3 enough times, then when we measure, we'll have a high chance of measuring a solution to the oracle.\n",
