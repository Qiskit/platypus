    "\n",
    "The problems generally increase in difficulty going further down, testing increasingly sophisticated skills. The section titles give an idea of what skill the problems intend to improve. If the problems in a given section are too easy, don't hesitate to skip them and take note that you have mastered the corresponding skill. If a problem is too challenging, try to figure out what makes the problem challenging and go back to earlier problems if necessary. \n",

    "When hints and answers are provided, try your best to **complete as much of the problem as you can first, then look at the hints and answers** when stuck or to check your work. Sometimes the answers will have further explanation and commentary, which will hopefully add perspective to the problem. Don't worry if you don't understand all of the explanation, or if you did the problem a different way. Hopefully, the hints and answers will add some interactivity to the problems and allow you to reflect on the material.\n",

Therefore, we only need to check things for an orthonormal basis. We might as well choose the standard basis since it’s easiest. By linearity, if $A$ keeps the length of standard basis vectors constant, $A$ will keep the length of every vector the same, and we’re done!”\n",
