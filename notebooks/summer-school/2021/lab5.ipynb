    "  <summary>Why I am getting such low fidelity?</summary>\n",
    "Make sure your target and target_unitary refer to the same circuit, and that if you are copying and pasting code, to check the variable names.\n",

    "<details>\n",
    "  <summary>I'm getting this output `&lt;NoiseModel on ['u2', 'reset', 'cx', 'u3', 'measure']&gt; U1 is missing`. Did I do something wrong?</summary>\n",
    "No nothing is wrong! That is because the time for u1 `time_u1=0`. So U1 is merely a virtual gate.\n",

    "  <summary>I'm getting this QiskitError: \"Unexpected state label '00 01', verify the fitter's state labels correspond to the input data\"</summary>\n",
    "How many qubits are in your circuit? Make sure it matches how many you are measuring.\n",

    "<details>\n",
    "  <summary>I'm getting this `QiskitError: \"Object of type ProcessTomographyFitter is not JSON serializable\"`</summary>\n",
    "The grader is expecting a float value called fidelity and not `ProcessTomographyFitter()` object.\n",

    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "  <summary>My circuit seems to be right but isn't being accepted by the grader.</summary>\n",
    "Use `.draw()` to draw the circuit you made and check whether you have put all angles and syntax right or not.\n",
