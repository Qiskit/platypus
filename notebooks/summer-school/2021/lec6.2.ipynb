    "In this lecture, Kristan covers three topics. Firstly, the theory behind feature maps, feature spaces, and kernels is introduced. This is then expanded into the idea of a quantum feature space, accompanied by examples. Secondly, Kristan introduces the circuit for the quantum kernel estimation (QKE). Next, Kristan discusses near-term applications, including a specific algorithm that uses QKE, i.e. a classification algorithm. And thirdly, Kristan discusses the choice of circuit for the unitary feature map, $U(X)$. Constrains on entries to the kernel are considered, and comparisons between QKE and classical kernels are made.\n",

    "  <summary>What is a kernel?</summary>\n",
    "Given a set of data, a kernel is a distance measure between attribute vectors taken from the data. It tells us how similar any two attribute vectors are. When given a feature map from the space of attributes to a higher dimensional space,  the kernel is just the inner product in that higher dimensional Euclidean space between the two feature vectors.\n",

    "<details>\n",
    "  <summary>Why is RBF infinite dimensional? Doesn’t it output a scalar?</summary>\n",
    "The RBF is infinite dimensional since the number of basis functions needed to construct the kernel will be infinite.See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUj5JbQihlU&t=1553s for a more detailed explanation.\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "  <summary>What is the sign function?</summary>\n",
    "The sign function is a non-linear function that return the sign of a real number, i.e. +1 or -1.\n",

    "  <summary>What is the Hilbert–Schmidt inner product?</summary>\n",
    "The Hilbert-Schmidt (HS) inner product is the inner product between two matrices within the vector space of matrices. It is also known as the trace inner product. The HS inner product for matrices A and B is given by tr[A^{dagger}B].\n",
