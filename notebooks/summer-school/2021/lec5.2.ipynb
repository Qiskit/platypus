    "The second lecture by Johannes was on the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and its applications. After a recap of the previous lecture, this lecture introduces Variational Quantum Eigensolvers (VQE), and starts with variational quantum circuits, and how they can effectively be used concurrently with classical optimizer. The second part is on Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO), and starts with optimization problems involving quadratic objective functions with linear and quadratic constraints. Johanes introduces the MaxCut problem and shows how to reframe it as QUBO.\n",
    "\n",
    "Johannes introduces QAOA by providing a brief history, and shows how to formulate it as a layered circuit in variational form. He explains cost layer and mixer layers, followed with an example for QAOA and visualizing the energy landscape to give better understanding for an optimization problem. The lecture covers adiabatic quantum computing concepts, followed by some recent results for QAOA such as use of Conditional Value-at-Risk to speed up the optimization process. There is an extensive set of references for those interested.\n",

    "### FAQ\n",
    " \n",
    "<details>\n",
    "  <summary>Please explain what is an approximation ratio?</summary>\n",
    "The approximation ratio is the ratio of the optimal value an algorithm achieves. So imagine that the true minimum of an optimization problem is 10 and an algorithm returns a solution with value 5, this would correspond to an approximation ratio of 0.5\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "  <summary>How can we build an efficient Ansatz in the VQE ?</summary>\n",
    "This is an active area of research. This paper has an overview of common ansaetze: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.08448.pdf\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "  <summary>Is there a particular technique to translate a problem into a corresponding Hamiltonian modelling it?</summary>\n",
    "Yes, so in one of the previous slides we derived how to turn a general quadratic optimization problem into a Hamiltonian\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "  <summary>Why do we need to solve MaxCut problem?</summary>\n",
    "A1: Many QUBO type problems can be rephrased as MaxCut problems, so if we solve MaxCut faster/better, the corresponding problems also gain that advantage.\n",
    "\n",
    "A2: MaxCut is NP complete. Therefore any other np complete (np hard) problem can be translated in terms of MaxCut via Karp reduction. So if you can solve MaxCut, then you can solve any other np complete problem.\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "  <summary>For VQE, if the gates are noisy, can we guarantee that after we restart the quantum part with the data from classical part the systems state trajectory moves along the previous previous trajectory. At the end considering quantum stochastic diff equations, there might be many trajectories depending on the noise?</summary>\n",
    "Noise can indeed affect the minimization. This paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.05018.pdf has various numerical results that discuss this. For instance, using lots of entanglers in the parameterized circuit can be a buffer against as long as the strength of the noise isn't too large.\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "  <summary>Only parallelism or any other reasons/benefits to choose quantum variational?</summary>\n",
    "Reduce the error\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "  <summary>Where will the barrier in the circuit be used?</summary>\n",
    "The barriers are only vor visualisation purposes\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "  <summary>Is there a possibility in adiabatic computing that the Hamiltonian is time dependent, and there are noncommutative operators and the Dyson expansion comes into the play? If yes, how is the simulation modified? should we use suzuki-trotter method?</summary>\n",
    "This paper actually talks about using a quantum computer to assist in the simulation of time dependent hamiltonians. https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.07677.pdf\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "  <summary>What's the difference between VQE and QAOA?</summary>\n",
    "You will see during the lecture that QAOA can be regarded as a special case of VQE where we choose the variational circuit according to the problem that we are looking at. So in a sense, VQE is more general in that we can choose an arbitrary variational form.\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "  <summary>Can we use quadratic programs for maximize problems?</summary>\n",
    "Yes QP's can be used both for maximisation and minimisation problems\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "  <summary>Since we have a hybrid classical quantum model, does the classical optimizer use the derivative to find the minimum? If it does, how do we find the derivative of the \"cost\" function?</summary>\n",
    "This entirely depends on the classical optimizer used. Some optimisers work without gradients and some optimisers estimate gradients by evaluating the cost function at different points.\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "  <summary>What is the Hamiltonian in your VQE example?</summary>\n",
    "The Hamiltonian depends on the optimization problem that we are looking at\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "  <summary>Why do we need the mixer Hamiltonian? Where does it come from?</summary>\n",
    "Without the mixer Hamiltonian, we could not use multiple layers of QAOA, since every cost layer has the same effect. So by alternating the cost and mixer layers we enlarge the space of quantum states that we can generate with out circuit. In the next section, you will also see that there is a connection between QAOA and adiabatic quantum computing which explains why we choose the mixer Hamiltonian the way we do.\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "  <summary>What features determine the number of mixed layers?</summary>\n",
    "In theory, the more layers, the better since we are able to generate a larger set of quantum states with more layers. However , with more layers of course noise becomes a problem and the optimization becomes harder since we have more parameters to optimise for.\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "  <summary>Sorry, what is the purpose of the mixer hamiltonian?</summary>\n",
    "See the Q&amp;A for a detailed answer but basically it perturbs our quantum state after applying the cost layer, allowing us to add more layers and explore a larger space of quantum states with our variational form.\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "  <summary>Does QAOA perform better on a noisy quantum computer than other algorithms(like shor,grover,deutch-josza)? If yes,how?</summary>\n",
    "Please check the Q&amp;A session for an answer to this question. But basically, the classical optimizer can correct for some systematic noise.\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "  <summary>You talk about limited device connectivity, can you please mention an example?</summary>\n",
    "So in the typical QAOA circuit we have interactions between arbitrary qubits, meaning there are two-bit gates applied to any possible qubit pair. However, real hardware devices are often not fully connected. That means qubit are usually positioned in a planar graph, like a grid, and two qubit gates can only be applied to qubits that are physically next to each other. We can convert arbitrary circuits into circuits that can be executed on hardware by introducing SWAP gates (these are gates that consist of three CNOT gates and SWAP the quantum states of two qubits), but that siginificantly increases the depth and number of gates in our circuit, making it more difficult to execute.\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "  <summary>What was the Hamiltonian again in simple language?</summary>\n",
    "The Hamiltonian is an operator that describes the energy of a system In our case you can think of it as a matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "The Hamiltonian contains all the information of the physical system. And its eigenvalues (when represented as a matrix) are the energies\n",

    "Johannes Weidenfeller The Hastings paper only makes statements about QAOA at low depth (p=1) and proponents of QAOA would argue that we only expect QAOA to work well for large p anyways. But there are a lot of factors that still limit the performance of QAOA in the near future,, simply because we can not run very deep algorithms on current machines. In a sense the question of QAOA performance can be split up in two parts. First of all, if we could execute algorithms noise-free (or in the fault tolerant regime) what is the theoretical advantage of QAOA over classical algorithms? And then secondly, taking hardware limitations into account, what part of this possible advantage remains when we look at executing QAOA on actual devices. A lot is still unknown about the first question (also because we can not empirically test it yet for large problems) and the answer to the second question can be a bit discouraging when taking all factors into account. However, in the end there is still a very good chance that QAOA scales more efficiently than classical algorithms for some problems and so it remains to be seen if this will translate into an actual advantage in the future.\n",
