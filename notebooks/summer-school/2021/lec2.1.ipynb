    "After a basic understanding of Qubits, Dirac notations, Basic Gate operations (e.g. Hadamard Gate, NOT Gate, Controlled-NOT Gate, etc.), and Block Sphere representation of a Qubit, Elisa introduced few basic quantum algorithms by which we can understand how fast Quantum computer works and certain advantages over the classical system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Elisa introduced with Oracle operator, which we used to determine its property by using a minimum number of queries. By using the Oracle operator, we can build Phase Oracle, which we use in Deutsch-Jozsa Algorithm. Deutsch-Jozsa Algorithm used to determine whether a given function is constant (i.e. output will be all 0s or all 1s) or balanced (i.e output is combined of 0s and 1s). Elisa not only gave the intuition of this algorithm but also provided its mathematical implementation in a step-by-step procedure.\n",

    "<details>\n",
    "  <summary>What is an oracle?</summary>\n",
    "It’s just a black-box like device, that performs implementation in a function as a unitary operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, an oracle is like a 'black box'. It gets an input and creates an output that one can measure but actually cannot see inside the black box, which means one doesn't know its property (in this case, one doesn't know if the function is constant or balanced). The goal is to find the property of the oracle.\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "  <summary>Due to Superposition, we have to run quantum computers once. This is a huge speed advantage over classical systems. However, to measure a probability, we must run the quantum algorithm many times to get the meaningful probability given real-life noise. How does this speed factor vary between classical and quantum?</summary>\n",
    "It depends on a lot of noise. In the example of the Deutsch-Jozsa Algorithm, users can quickly determine whether the function is balanced or constant. Because you can only get one output from the circuit and the rest of the combinations are zero, the probability distribution is also based on it. Then you can a few shots at the same time, do the measurements, and get a higher chance (above 90%) to get the correct output.\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "  <summary>What are Balanced Function and Constant Function in the Oracle?</summary>\n",
    "If a function with n-qubits input gives n number of 0s (all 0s) or n number of 1s (all 1s) regardless of the input, then that function is known as Constant Function whereas, If a function with n-qubits gives half-of the n numbers of 0s and another half as 1s, then the function is balanced.\n",
    "\n",
    "In another way, we can mention that a function ‘f’ is called balanced if it is equal to 1 for exactly half of all the possible x, and 0 for the other half.\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "  <summary>For the Quantum solution of the algorithms, how to determine the number of qubits need to use in this algorithm?</summary>\n",
    "It depends on the function on which this algorithm is implemented.\n",
