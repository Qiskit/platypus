    "This lecture is the continuation of the previous (2.1) lecture and discusses Grover's algorithm after discussing the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm in lecture 2.1. Grover's algorithm searches unsorted databases, and is one of the most famous quantum algorithms.\n",

    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "  <summary>What is the speed up of Grover's algorithm and how can it be proved?</summary>\n",
    "In the case of Grover the speed up is quadratic which can be proven to be a separation between quantum and classical. For other algorithms like Shor's algorithm it seems like we can get an exponential speed up, but this has not been proven.\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "  <summary>How can Grover's algorithm be proven to be asymptotically the best searching algorithm that we have?</summary>\n",
    "Refer to Chapter 3, Quantum Computation and Quantum Information (Nielsen and Chuang).\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "  <summary>How many qubits would be practically required to find an element in an unordered list?</summary>\n",
    "With n qubits you get 2 to the power of n different states. So for a million elements you would need 20 qbits. You need logarithmically many qubits.\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "  <summary>As we increase theta, does the error increase?</summary>\n",
    "We calculated an upper bound for the error. But in general we just care about m over n, where m is the number of marked elements and n the total number of elements. But it decreases exponentially small, so we can do it a couple of times.\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "  <summary>How does one apply an oracle in real life?</summary>\n",
    "That depends on the function we want to implement. Usually for satisfiability problems. There is a number of such functions in Qiskit.\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "  <summary>Is quantum amplitude estimation related to Grover’s algorithm?</summary>\n",
    "It depends. The original version of quantum amplitude estimation uses quantum phase estimation. It has been recently shown that you can just use Grover instead.\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "  <summary>How much math do you have to know to follow the lab?</summary>\n",
    "I think not so much. The oracles do the math. You can always see the functions they define as given. Ideally you understand what the functions do.\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "  <summary>What does orthogonal mean?</summary>\n",
    "Orthogonal means that there is no overlap at all. If we look at the two dimensional plane two vectors are normal to each other. (They stand in a 90 degree angle.) In the end it means that when I take the inner product of two vectors I get zero.\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "  <summary>How is time complexity faster than classical?</summary>\n",
    "It scales proportional to r and r scales like the square root of n. Overall the algorithm’s time complexity scales as the square root of n.\n",
