    "The lecture is divided into two broad parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Part-1: Linear classifiers\n",
    "    - Introduces the classical concepts of linear classifier, the two formulations of its optimisation function, along with the widely used Kernel trick.\n",
    "- Part-2: Quantum Feature Maps\n",
    "    - Extends the idea of the classical kernel trick to a quantum version, first explaining the concept of quantum feature maps and applying them in introducing a model called Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC). Thereafter, linking in spirit with part-1, Bryce presents a proof that the VQC is indeed a linear classifier, implying that the kernel trick is valid for use in a VQC; finally presenting the quantum kernel estimator (QKE) in the lecture’s conclusion.\n",

    "### FAQ\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "  <summary>Is VQC a mere variation of the previously seen VQE (variational quantum estimator)?</summary>\n",
    "No. VQE seeks to search for the lowest energy state of a hamiltonian that encodes a problem, whereas, in VQC the data to be classified is first encoded via a quantum feature map in a state, and thereafter an iterative optimisation is carried out on a parameterized hamiltonian. The optimal hamiltonian is what we seek in VQC.\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "  <summary>What are Lagrange Multipliers?</summary>\n",
    "Lagrange multipliers appear in the mathematical optimisation method of Lagrange multipliers, which is used to find the local maxima and minima of a function subject to certain constraint equations. A detailed explained is deferred to the notes by Andrew Ng referred to above.\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "  <summary>What about the quantum advantage of a VQC?</summary>\n",
    "The quantum advantage of a VQC comes in play only when using a quantum feature map that is classically hard to compute, hence rendering a computation of the kernel function a classically tough task but an easy-to-do task on a quantum computer.\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "  <summary>Examples of a classically hard to compute kernel that is easier to do on a quantum computer?</summary>\n",
    "The DLog i.e. the discrete log kernel, however it’s not of much “practical” use/applications.\n",
