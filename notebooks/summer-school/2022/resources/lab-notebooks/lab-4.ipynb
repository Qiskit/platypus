    "One of the leading uses for quantum computers will be to simulate quantum systems such as molecules or engineered materials. Actually executing a quantum simulation on a current quantum computer, however, can be difficult and error prone. Your objective for this lab is to complete the exercises and then improve on them to get the highest state tomography score (more details in Section 2).\n",
    "\n",
    "The quantum system you will simulate is a quantum spin-1/2 model, where each qubit represents a quantum [spin-1/2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin-1/2) particle in a 1D chain. Quantum spin models have some amazing properties and uses. Computationally speaking, [certain optimization problems can be mapped](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.05771.pdf) to spin models and hence minimized on a quantum computer. Physically speaking, spin models show a variety of quantum behavior such as large entangled states, quantum phases of matter, quantum many-body affects, and many other open questions in physics research.\n",

    "There are many different spin models, but we will focus on the [$XXX$ Heisenberg spin model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_Heisenberg_model#XXX_model). Though it is not as well known as the [transverse-field Ising model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transverse-field_Ising_model), the $XXX$ Heisenberg model is of practical and theoretical interest. It can also be difficult to simulate, which is where you come in.\n",

    "1) Section 1 (labeled 1-X) provides you with brief introductions to the $XXX$ Heisenberg model, time evolving a Hamiltonian, and decomposing a time evolution operator into gates for a quantum computer to execute.\n",
    "2) Section 2 (labeled 2-X) outlines the specific requirements and boundaries associated with completing the exercises and competing for the best score. Completing the exercises will give you an example solution. Once you've completed the exercises, feel free to modify your answers to get the best score."

    "To execute $U_{\\text{Heis3}}(t)$ on a [circuit model](https://qiskit.org/documentation/apidoc/circuit.html) quantum computer, we must decompose $U_{\\text{Heis3}}(t)$ into a product of single and two-qubit gates that are native to that quantum computer. There are a [variety of techniques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_simulation) to do this. For this lab, you will only use [Trotterization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_simulation#Product_Formulas) (which is sometimes referred to as the Suzuki-Trotterization decomposition, Trotter formulas, product formulas, and other names).\n",

However, we can approximate $U_{\\text{Heis3}}(t)$ as a product of simpler exponentials through Trotterization. Consider a subsystem of 2 spin-1/2 particles within the larger 3 spin system. The Hamiltonian on spins $i$ and $j$ ($i,j \\in \\{0,1,2\\}$) would be $H^{(i,j)}_{\\text{Heis2}} = \\sigma_x^{(i)}\\sigma_x^{(j)} + \\sigma_y^{(i)}\\sigma_y^{(j)} + \\sigma_z^{(i)}\\sigma_z^{(j)}$.

    "You are to time evolve the state $|110\\rangle$ to time $t=\\pi$ under the $XXX$ Heisenberg model Hamiltonian $H_{\\text{heis3}}$ as defined in Section 1. This will be done on the ibmq_manila quantum computer and noisy simulator. The qubits in the state $|110\\rangle$ could correspond to any three qubits of ibmq_manila. The evolution must be done using Trotterization with at least 4 steps ($n\\geq 4$). You will compete based on the fidelity of the evolved state at time $t=\\pi$ using [state tomography](https://qiskit.org/documentation/tutorials/noise/8_tomography.html). State tomography is a way of determining the exact quantum state--even phase information--at the end of a quantum circuit by running the circuit multiple times and measuring in different bases. The closer your final quantum state to the expected state, the higher the fidelity. As you work on your solution, other important elements to consider are clarity of your code and how many different techniques you can learn and bring together. This is a great time to practice a variety of skills. Ibmq_manila's remaining two qubits will not be evaluated by the state tomography calculation, so you may use them as you wish. You do not need to follow the same decomposition given in the example above, but your solution must be a Trotterization of $U_{\\text{heis3}}(t)$ with at least 4 steps ($n\\geq 4$). You will find it useful to implement ideas and techniques you learned during this summer school that reduce errors and improve qubit coherence."
