Circuit depth is defined in detail [here](https://qiskit.org/documentation/apidoc/circuit.html) (See the Supplementary Information and click the Quantum Circuit Properties tab). Circuit depth is proportional to the number of gates in a circuit, and loosely corresponds to the runtime of the circuit on hardware.   Therefore, circuit depth is an easy to compute metric that can be used to estimate the fidelity of an executed circuit.\n",
