#  === Structure of the Qiskit Textbook ===
#
# This textbook is organised into 'courses', which are ordered lists of
# 'sections'. Sections are the smallest unit of content in this textbook,
# i.e. a single Jupyter notebook which is converted to a single web page.
#
# Below is a fake example of a simple course.
#
# - title: My course
#   url: /my-course   # pages in this course will have urls starting with
#                     # 'https://learn.qiskit.org/course/my-course'
#   sections:  # ordered list of notebooks
#     - title: My page  # Appears at top of page and in left sidebar
#       id: my-page     # Stem of the url for this page on the website,
#                       # i.e. this page will have url 'https://learn.qiskit.org/course/my-course/my-page'
#       uuid: a5a86ddc-b519-11ec-b909-0242ac120002  # Unique ID for
#                       # website software to identify pages if names change.
#                       # Generate new ids with https://www.uuidgenerator.net

        Quantum computing has become a global conversation, and whether in
        media or movies, fact or fiction, the excitement for quantum is growing
        every day. This free course covers quantum information at a detailed
        mathematical level. Join John Watrous as you explore quantum
        information, quantum algorithms, and how to understand and mitigate
        noise.

      To make the most out of this course, we recommend familiarity with basic
      linear algebra, complex numbers, and elementary mathematical notions
      including sets and functions. You may also want to install Qiskit to run
      your own code. The following sources are a few among many that cover this

        Not sure where to start? This path is for you. This introduction is
        aimed at audiences from all backgrounds. Whether you're keen to start
        your journey into quantum computing, or just curious as to what it's
        all about, this course will take you from zero to one, without the hand
        waving.
      long: |
        This short course contains around 3 hours of content and is aimed at
        self-learners from all backgrounds (technical and non-technical). The
        aim of this course is to give a solid understanding of the principles
        behind quantum computing, focussing on developing intuition. After this
        course, you will have a fair understanding of quantum computing and
        Qiskit, as well as a short project demonstrating it. You should then be
        able to jump straight into many of the other courses in this textbook
        when they are ready, including traditional algorithms and protocols,
        near term quantum algorithms, and quantum machine learning.

        Want to learn about this exciting, developing field? If you're familiar
        with quantum computing basics, this course will give you a primer on
        machine learning, walk you through key concepts, and bring you up to
        speed with recent developments.
      long: |
        This course contains around eight hours of content, and is aimed at
        self-learners who are comfortable with undergraduate-level mathematics
        and quantum computing fundamentals. This course will take you through
        key concepts in quantum machine learning, such as parameterized quantum
        circuits, training these circuits, and applying them to basic problems.
        By the end of the course, you'll understand the state of the field, and
        you'll be familiar with recent developments in both supervised and
        unsupervised learning such as quantum kernels and general adversarial
        networks. This course finishes with a project that you can use to
        showcase what you've learnt.

        This course was created by IBM Quantum with the help of Qiskit Advocates
        through the Qiskit Advocate Mentoring Program.

        This chapter introduces the computing concepts that we'll explore in
        later chapters, then introduces basic quantum concepts.
      long: |
        If you think quantum mechanics sounds challenging, you’re not alone.
        Our intuitions come from day-to-day experiences, and so are better at
        understanding the behavior of balls and bananas than atoms or
        electrons. Though quantum objects can seem random and chaotic at first,
        they just follow a different set of rules. Once we know what those
        rules are, we can use them to create new and powerful technology.
        Quantum computing will be the most revolutionary example of this.

    description:
      short: |
        All circuit-based quantum devices share some similar characteristics
        and challenges. In this chapter, we explore how quantum circuits
        perform on modern quantum computers, and ways to improve performance.
      long: |
        Most gate-based quantum computers share similar challenges with noise
        and errors. These pages explore how errors affect quantum circuits, and
        how we can mitigate them, without worrying about the physics of the
        device itself.
    prerequisites:
      - title: Multiple Qubits and Entanglement
        description: |
          With the basics down, this chapter explores the consequences of these
          new quantum effects, and sets us up with tools to understand quantum
          algorithms.

        In this chapter, we get a level closer to the real quantum machines.
        Learn about the physics of these devices, and how to program them at
        the level of microwave pulses.
      long: |
        The Qiskit Textbook mostly assumes we have a quantum computer that can
        carry out quantum operations, and doesn't worry about how the devices
        actually work. These pages go a step deeper, exploring the physics of
        superconducting qubits, and using Qiskit to program operations on these
        devices at the level of microwave pulses.

        can use to investigate the behaviour of current quantum computers and
        practice your Qiskit coding skills.

        These pages are hands-on exercises that interact with IBM Quantum's
        real quantum systems. Aimed at late-undergraduate / early-graduate
        courses, these lab modules start cover basic quantum circuits, to
        exploring core algorithms such as Grover search and Shor's algorithm.
        These pages tackle the limitations of today's quantum computers, and
        ways to account for them.
