    "\n",
    "Suppose that we have a [system](gloss:system) that stores information. Specifically, we'll assume that this system can be in one [*classical state*](gloss:classical-state) at each instant.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest possible system is the bit, a system whose classical states are 0 and 1. This is the archetypal example, and we'll come back to it repeatedly. Other examples include:\n",
    "- a standard six-sided die, whose classical states are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6\n",
    "- a nucleobase in a strand of DNA, whose classical states are *A*, *C*, *G*, and *T*, and\n",
    "- a switch on an electric fan, whose classical states are (commonly) *high*, *medium*, *low*, and *off*.\n",
    "\n",
    "We usually look at systems in the world around us and identify their different states to help create a mental model of how they work. Mathematically, however, specifying a system's classical states is the starting point: we _define_ a bit to be a system that has classical states 0 and 1, and likewise for systems with different classical state sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this discussion, we'll use '$\\mathsf{X}$' to refer the system we're considering, and use '$\\class{_sigma}{\\Sigma}$' to refer to the set of classical states of $\\mathsf{X}$. For simplicity, we'll assume $\\Sigma$ is finite; while it can be sensible to consider physical systems with an infinite number of classical states, we'll ignore this for now. We'll also assume that $\\Sigma$ is nonempty, as it's nonsensical for a physical system to have no states at all. From now on, we'll use *classical state set* to mean *a finite and nonempty set*.\n",

    "- If $\\mathsf{X}$ is a bit, then $\\class{_sigma}{\\Sigma} = \\class{_set_brackets}{{\\{0,1\\}}}$,\n",

    "- if $\\mathsf{X}$ is an electric fan switch, then $\\Sigma = \\{\\mathrm{high},\\mathrm{medium},\\mathrm{low},\\mathrm{off}\\}$.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "For example, suppose $\\mathsf{X}$ is a bit. Based on what we know or guess has happened to $\\mathsf{X}$ in the past, we might believe that $\\mathsf{X}$ has a 3/4 chance of being in the classical state 0, and a 1/4 chance of being the state 1. We can represent this belief by writing:\n",

    "Supposing that the result were tails, we'd naturally update our description of the probabilistic state of the coin to be $|\\text{tails}\\rangle$. Of course, if we were then to cover the coin, uncover it, and look at it again, the classical state would obviously still be tails, which matches our mathematical description. This may seem trivial, and in some sense it is — but in recognizing this triviality, the analogous behavior for quantum information might seem less unusual.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to remember that probabilistic states describe knowledge or belief, and not necessarily something actual.\n",
    "\n",
    "The state of our coin after we flip it (but before we look) _is_ either heads or tails, we simply do not know which. Looking at the coin does not change the state of the coin, only our knowledge of it. If we see the classical state of the coin is tails, we'd naturally update our knowledge by assigning the probabilistic state $|\\text{tails}\\rangle$ to the coin. To anyone who couldn't see the coin being uncovered, the probabilistic state of the coin would remain unchanged and would be described by the old probability vector. This is not a cause for concern: different individuals may have different knowledge or beliefs about of a particular system, and hence describe that system by different probability vectors."

Unfortunately, humans find it more difficult to think about our data in terms of bits (e.g., if we store an image in some bits, what would we need do to those bits to make the image brighter? Or convert it to black and white?). For this reason, many programming languages add a layer of abstraction so users can avoid thinking on the bit level.\n",

We say '<code>v</code>' refers to a \"<code>Statevector</code> object\".\n",
