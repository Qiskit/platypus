    "For example, this description is used to model the effects of *noise* on quantum computations, and more generally it serves as a mathematical basis for quantum information theory and quantum cryptography.\n",
    "It is also quite beautiful from a mathematical perspective.\n",

    "The state of our coin after we flip it, but before we look, is either heads or tails and we simply do not know which until we look — and doing so does not actually change the state of the coin, but only our knowledge of it.\n",
    "Upon seeing that the classical state of the coin is tails, say, we naturally update our knowledge by assigning the probabilistic state $|\\text{tails}\\rangle$ to the coin — but to someone else in the room who couldn't see the coin when it was uncovered, the probabilistic state of the coin would remain unchanged and would be described by the probability vector specified previously.\n",
