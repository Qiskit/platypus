ket_psi:
  notation: $| \psi \rangle$
  description: >
    Ket: a type of vector we use to represent quantum states. The 'ψ' is the
      label, and the |⟩ remind us this is a quantum state vector. This notation
      is called 'Dirac', or 'bra-ket' notation.

bra:
  notation: $\langle \psi |$
  description: >
    Bra: the conjugate-transpose of |ψ⟩ (its corresponding ket). Using standard
      matrix multiplication rules, multiplying with a ket on the
      right-hand-side gives a scalar, and a ket on the left-hand-side gives a
      matrix.

tensor_product:
  notation: $ \otimes $
  description: >
    Tensor product: a rule for combining two vectors into a larger vector.

sum:
  notation: $ \sum $
  description: >
    Sum: This is read as ‘sum of’, see summation notation on Wikipedia.

magnitude:
  notation: $\| x \|$
  description: >
    Magnitude: the 'size' of the object between the vertical lines. For
    vectors, this is the square-root of the sum of each element squared.

set_membership:
  notation: $ \in $
  description: >
    Set membership: anything to the left of the symbol is an element of the set
    on the right. You can read this symbol as 'in'.

proper_subset:
  notation: $ \subseteq $
  description: >
    Subset: the set to the left of this symbol only contains elements of the
    set to the right.

subset:
  notation: $ \subset $
  description: >
    Proper subset: the set on the left is a 'proper' subset of the set on the
    right. That is, the two sets are not equal.

hilbert_space:
  notation: $ \mathcal{H} $
  description: >
    This is the symbol for ‘Hilbert Space’, which is a complex vector space
    which is where all qubit vector states ‘live’, every possible vector within
    the Hilbert space can be represented using a combination of |0⟩ and |1⟩.

real_number:
  notation: $ \mathbb{R} $
  description: >
    The set of all real numbers (as opposed to imaginary numbers).

complex_number:
  notation: $ \mathbb{C} $
  description: >
    The set of all complex numbers (numbers with an imaginary part). Since the
    imaginary part can be zero, this set includes the set of all real numbers
    as a subset.

for_all:
  notation: $ \forall $
  description: >
    This is read as ‘for all’.

identity_matrix:
  notation: $ I $
  description: >
    Identity gate/matrix. This is a gate or matrix that has no effect.

unitary_matrix:
  notation: $ U $
  description: >
    Often used to represent a unitary matrix, which is a matrix that, when
    multiplied by its conjugate transpose, will produce an identity matrix.
