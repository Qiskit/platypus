For example, a car on a road can have a certain mass, position, speed, or acceleration that characterize its state. Similarly, quantum systems can also have different configurations or states, but they differ from classical systems in how we deal with measurements and state evolution. This leads to unique properties such as *superposition* and *entanglement* that are exclusive to quantum mechanics. Just like we can describe a car's state using physical properties like speed or acceleration, we can also describe the state of a quantum system using *observables*, which are mathematical objects.\n",
