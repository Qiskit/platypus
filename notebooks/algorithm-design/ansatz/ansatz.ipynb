Quantitatively, its dimensionality is $D = 2^{2n}$. To make matters worse, the runtime complexity of search algorithms, and others alike, grows exponentially with this dimensionality, a phenomenon often referred to in the literature as the curse of dimensionality.\n",

This is because the local gates can act on neighboring qubits and create entanglement between them, which can be important for simulating complex quantum systems.\n",

    "- For a rotation layer, the gates are stacked on top of each other. We can use standard rotation operations, such as [`RX`](https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.circuit.library.RXGate.html) or [`CRZ`](https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.circuit.library.CRZGate.html).\n",
    "- For an entanglement layer, we can use gates like [`Toffoli` gates](https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.circuit.library.CCXGate.html) or [`CX`](https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.circuit.library.CXGate.html#qiskit.circuit.library.CXGate) with an entanglement strategy.\n",
    "- Both types of layers can be parameterized or not, but at least one of them needs to contain parameters. Otherwise, without at least one parameter, there wouldn't be any variations!\n",
